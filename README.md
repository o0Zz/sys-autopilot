# sys-autopilot

A Nintendo Switch (Atmosphère) sysmodule that runs a persistent HTTP server on
the console. It exposes a REST API **and a native MCP (Model Context Protocol)
endpoint** for taking screenshots, injecting controller input, and
reading/writing files on the SD card — everything an AI agent needs to drive
the Switch while testing homebrew applications.

Typical agent loop:

1. `curl -T myapp.nro` — deploy a fresh build
2. `screenshot` + `tap_buttons` MCP tools — navigate to hbmenu and launch it
3. `screenshot` / `read_file` — observe the app and its log files, iterate

## Requirements

- Switch running [Atmosphère](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere) CFW
- Firmware **10.0.0+** (uses the native `caps:sc` JPEG screenshot command)
- Building: [devkitPro](https://devkitpro.org/) with `switch-dev` (devkitA64 + libnx)

## Building

```sh
make            # builds sys-autopilot.nsp (the sysmodule exefs)
make dist       # assembles an SD-card-ready tree under dist/
make -C app     # builds the dev .nro flavor (see below)
./tests/run.sh  # host-side test suite (no devkitPro required)
```

## Installing

Download the latest `sys-autopilot-<version>.zip` from
[Releases](https://github.com/TooTallNate/sys-autopilot/releases) and extract
it to the root of your SD card. Or build from source and copy the contents of
`dist/` to the root of your SD card:

```
atmosphere/contents/4200000000004150/exefs.nsp
atmosphere/contents/4200000000004150/flags/boot2.flag
config/sys-autopilot/config.ini
```

Reboot. The server starts automatically at boot (boot2) and listens on port
4150 by default.

> The console is held awake while the sysmodule runs, because sleep powers
> down the WLAN module and the server stops answering until someone presses a
> button on the console. Set `keep_awake = false` in `config.ini` to let it
> sleep normally.

## Configuration

`sdmc:/config/sys-autopilot/config.ini` (created automatically on first boot
if missing):

```ini
[server]
; TCP port the HTTP server listens on.
port = 4150

; Name advertised on the local network via mDNS / DNS-SD (Bonjour).
; The console becomes reachable at '<hostname>.local' and advertises the
; '_sys-autopilot._tcp' service so clients can discover it without an IP.
; Leave blank to auto-generate 'switch-<last 4 of serial>' (unique per console).
hostname =

; Optional authentication. Auth is enforced when EITHER a bearer token
; is set, or both username and password are set (HTTP Basic).
; Clients may then use 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' or Basic auth.
; Setting username+password also enables the OAuth browser login flow
; for MCP clients (see below).
token =
username =
password =

; Write diagnostics to log.txt next to this file (the sysmodule has no
; console output). Off by default; set to true when troubleshooting.
log = false

[power]
; Hold off auto-sleep while this sysmodule runs. Sleep powers down the
; WLAN module, so the console stops answering until someone presses a
; button on it. Nothing is persisted: set this to false and the console
; sleeps again according to System Settings.
keep_awake = true
```

Changes take effect after a reboot. Note this is plain HTTP — auth protects
against casual LAN access only. OAuth-issued tokens live in
`config/sys-autopilot/tokens.txt` next to this file.

> The sysmodule has no console output. To capture diagnostics, set `log = true`
> in `config.ini` and reboot — it appends to
> `sdmc:/config/sys-autopilot/log.txt`.

## Network discovery (mDNS / Bonjour)

So you don't have to chase the console's DHCP-assigned IP, the sysmodule
advertises itself on the local network via multicast DNS (the same Bonjour /
zeroconf mechanism used by printers and Chromecasts). Two things are exposed:

- **A hostname** — the console answers to `<hostname>.local`. When `hostname`
  is blank it defaults to `switch-<last 4 of serial>` (e.g. `switch-5322`),
  unique per console. Use it anywhere you'd use the IP:

  ```sh
  curl http://switch-5322.local:4150/status
  ```

- **A discoverable service** — `_sys-autopilot._tcp`. Clients can find every
  console on the subnet without knowing any name or IP, then read its details
  from the advertised TXT record:

  | TXT key | Example | Meaning |
  |---|---|---|
  | `version` | `1.3.0` | sys-autopilot version |
  | `path` | `/mcp` | MCP endpoint path |
  | `auth` | `oauth` / `token` / `none` | Configured auth scheme |
  | `model` | `oled` | Console model (`v1`/`v2`/`lite`/`oled`) |
  | `firmware` | `19.0.1` | Horizon OS version |
  | `atmosphere` | `1.7.1` | Atmosphère/Exosphère version (when available) |

Browse from any machine on the same network:

```sh
# Convenience wrapper (auto-detects dns-sd or avahi):
scripts/discover.sh

# …or use the platform tools directly:
dns-sd -B _sys-autopilot._tcp           # macOS / Windows (Bonjour)
avahi-browse -r _sys-autopilot._tcp     # Linux (avahi-utils)
```

The serial-based default keeps multiple consoles from colliding; set an
explicit `hostname` in `config.ini` if you'd prefer a friendly name.

> mDNS is **link-local**: it works within a single subnet but does not cross
> routers/VLANs/VPNs. For cross-subnet access, give the console a DHCP
> reservation and a name on your router/DNS instead.

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

The sysmodule speaks MCP natively at `POST /mcp` (stateless Streamable HTTP
transport, JSON-RPC 2.0). Point any MCP client directly at the console:

```jsonc
// .mcp.json (Claude Code), or equivalent in Cursor/VS Code/etc.
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "switch": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://switch-5322.local:4150/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <token from config.ini>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Omit `headers` when auth is not configured. Replace
`switch-5322.local` with your console's `<hostname>.local` (or its IP
if mDNS isn't available on your network).

### OAuth browser login (no manual headers)

When `username` and `password` are set in `config.ini`, sys-autopilot also
acts as a minimal OAuth 2.1 authorization server. MCP clients that support
the spec's auth flow (Claude Code, etc.) need **zero manual configuration**:
add the server URL, and on the first 401 the client discovers the OAuth
metadata, opens your browser at a login page served by the Switch, and after
you sign in with the config.ini credentials it receives a bearer token
automatically.

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http switch http://switch-5322.local:4150/mcp
# first use triggers the browser login
```

Details:

- Issued tokens are **non-expiring** and stored one-per-line in
  `sdmc:/config/sys-autopilot/tokens.txt` (with an `# issued <date>` comment).
  Revoke a token by deleting its line — the file is re-read when it changes.
- Implements RFC 9728 protected-resource metadata, RFC 8414 AS metadata,
  RFC 7591 dynamic client registration, and the authorization-code grant
  with PKCE S256 (required).
- The static `token =` and HTTP Basic options still work for clients without
  OAuth support.
- Note: it's OAuth over plain HTTP on your LAN — the flow is for
  *convenience*, not transport security. A few clients hard-require HTTPS
  for OAuth; for those, fall back to a static token header.

### Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `screenshot` | Returns the current screen as an **image content block** — the agent sees it directly |
| `tap_buttons` | Press + release buttons (`buttons: ["A"]`, optional `durationMs`) |
| `tap_sequence` | Up to 32 taps in one call (menu navigation without round-trips) |
| `hold_buttons` / `release_buttons` | Persistent button state |
| `set_stick` | Analog stick (`side`, `x`/`y` in -1..1, optional `durationMs`) |
| `clear_input` | Release everything, recenter sticks |
| `status` | Server version, firmware, controller state, uptime, battery % / charging |
| `list_directory` | JSON listing of an SD card directory |
| `read_file` | Read text files (32 KB pages, negative `offset` = tail) — ideal for logs |
| `upload_file` | Write a file (base64 `content`, **streamed to SD — no size cap**) |
| `delete_file` | Delete a file / empty directory |
| `hash_file` | SHA-256 a file (streamed, any size); optional `expected` returns `matched` — verify an upload in one call |
| `get_theme` / `set_theme` | Read / set the system UI theme (`light` or `dark`; the visible change applies after the HOME menu reloads — sleep/wake or reboot) |
| `get_nickname` / `set_nickname` | Read / set the console's device nickname |
| `get_brightness` / `set_brightness` | Read / set screen brightness (`0.0`–`1.0`) |
| `get_volume` / `set_volume` | Read / set master volume (`0.0`–`1.0`) |
| `process_status` | Is the program with this `titleId` running? Returns its pid |
| `process_start` / `process_stop` | Launch / terminate a program by `titleId` (works for sysmodules with no `boot2.flag`) |
| `process_restart` | Stop, wait for it to actually exit, then start — the normal way to load a rebuilt sysmodule |
| `airplane_mode` | Enable airplane mode (disable wireless). **One-way: cuts the server off; cannot be undone remotely** |

Button names: `A B X Y L R ZL ZR PLUS MINUS UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT LSTICK RSTICK
HOME CAPTURE` (aliases: `START`, `SELECT`, `DUP/DDOWN/DLEFT/DRIGHT`).

`upload_file` note: content is streamed through a JSON scanner and
base64-decoded straight to disk, so the file size is bounded by the SD card,
not RAM. But MCP tool arguments are generated token-by-token by the model, so
multi-megabyte uploads are context-expensive — deploy `.nro` builds with
`curl -T` against the raw HTTP API instead.

## REST API

All endpoints return JSON unless noted. POST endpoints take JSON request
bodies. When auth is configured, send `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (or
Basic) with every request.

The `<ip>` in the examples below can be replaced with the console's
mDNS name (e.g. `switch-5322.local`) — see
[Network discovery](#network-discovery-mdns--bonjour).

### Screenshots

```
GET /screenshot[?stack=screenshot|default|lcd|recording|lastframe]
```

Returns the current screen as `image/jpeg` (1280x720).

```sh
curl -o screen.jpg http://<switch-ip>:4150/screenshot
```

### Controller input

A virtual Pro Controller is attached automatically on the first input request
(it becomes player 1 when no physical controllers are connected).

```
POST /input/tap      {"buttons":["A","B"],"durationMs":100}
POST /input/hold     {"buttons":["ZL"]}
POST /input/release  {"buttons":["ZL"]}
POST /input/stick    {"side":"left","x":1.0,"y":0.0,"durationMs":500}
POST /input/clear    (empty body)
POST /controller/attach | /controller/detach
```

`x`/`y` are floats in `[-1.0, 1.0]`. With `durationMs`, `/input/stick`
recenters afterwards. Durations are capped at 10s.

```sh
curl -X POST http://<ip>:4150/input/tap \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"buttons":["RIGHT"]}'
```

### Files

All paths are rooted at the SD card (`sdmc:`); `..` traversal is rejected.

```
GET    /files?path=/switch/myapp/log.txt          download / read a file
GET    /files?path=/switch/myapp/log.txt&offset=-4096   tail: last 4 KB
GET    /files/hash?path=/switch/myapp.nro          SHA-256 digest (JSON)
GET    /files?path=/switch/                       directory listing (JSON)
PUT    /files?path=/switch/myapp.nro              upload (raw request body)
DELETE /files?path=/switch/myapp.nro              delete file / empty dir
```

```sh
# Deploy a build
curl -T myapp.nro "http://<ip>:4150/files?path=/switch/myapp.nro"
# Verify it landed intact (compare against `shasum -a 256 myapp.nro`)
curl "http://<ip>:4150/files/hash?path=/switch/myapp.nro"
# Tail a log
curl "http://<ip>:4150/files?path=/switch/myapp/debug.log&offset=-2048"
```

### Install a title

Stream an **NSP** or **XCI** straight to the console and install it (NCM content
storage + application record) — no SD-card staging, nothing to clean up
afterwards. The title appears on the HOME menu when done. The container format
is auto-detected from the stream, so the same endpoint handles both.

```
POST|PUT /install[?storage=sd|nand]    install a streamed NSP or XCI (default: sd)
```

```sh
# -g disables curl globbing so the [titleId] brackets in the name are literal.
curl -g -T "Game [0100...000][v0].nsp" "http://<ip>:4150/install"
# -> {"ok":true,"titleId":"0100...000","version":0,"message":"installed ..."}

# XCI works the same way (the NCAs in its "secure" partition are installed):
curl -g -T "Game [0100...000][v0].xci" "http://<ip>:4150/install"

# install to internal storage instead of the SD card:
curl -g -T game.nsp "http://<ip>:4150/install?storage=nand"
```

The file is streamed (its size comes from `Content-Length`, which `curl -T`
sends), so multi-GB titles install without buffering to disk. For NSP, each
NCA's SHA-256 is verified against its content id as it is written; a failed
install rolls back the content it wrote. (XCI gamecard NCAs are not guaranteed
to hash to their filename id, so that per-NCA check is skipped for XCI; the
meta NCA is still verified.) Both trimmed and full XCI layouts are supported.

> Uncompressed containers only — decompress **NSZ** on the host first (see
> Compressed NSZ below). Installing commercial titles still requires a valid
> ticket and, for some games, a linked account — that is the title's own DRM,
> independent of the installer.

#### Compressed NSZ

The console only understands plain NSP (uncompressed NCAs); decompressing an
**NSZ** on-device would force a multi-MB zstd window to live permanently in the
sysmodule, so the decompression is done on the host instead. The included
`install-nsz` script reads an `.nsz`, decompresses + re-encrypts each `.ncz`
into a plain NCA on the fly, and streams a reconstructed NSP straight to
`/install` (nothing is buffered to disk; the console still verifies every NCA
hash as it lands):

```sh
# one-time: install the host dependencies
pnpm install

node scripts/install-nsz.mjs "Game [0100...000][v0].nsz" http://<ip>:4150 --netrc
# -> HTTP 200: {"ok":true,"titleId":"0100...000","version":0,"message":"installed ..."}

# options: --storage nand   --user <u> --pass <p>   --dry-run (verify locally, no upload)
```

`--netrc` reads HTTP Basic credentials from `~/.netrc` for the console's host.
Use `--dry-run` to decompress and validate the reconstructed NSP size locally
without touching a console.

### List installed titles

List the applications installed on the console (base titles only — not updates
or DLC), across the SD card, internal storage, and an inserted gamecard.

```
GET /titles
```

```json
{"titles":[
  {"titleId":"0100000000010000","version":0,"storage":"sd","name":"Some Game"},
  {"titleId":"0100000000020000","version":0,"storage":"nand","name":"Another Game"}
]}
```

`name` is the title's display name (from its control data); it may be empty if
the control data isn't available. `storage` is `sd`, `nand`, or `gamecard`.
Also exposed as the `list_installed_titles` MCP tool.

### Network DNS

Read or change the DNS servers for the active network connection. Useful for
pointing the console at a custom/black-hole DNS (e.g. 90DNS) while keeping it on
the LAN.

```
GET  /network/dns                                  read current DNS config
POST /network/dns                                  set DNS
```

```sh
curl --netrc "http://<ip>:4150/network/dns"
# -> {"automatic":true,"primary":"192.168.1.1","secondary":"0.0.0.0"}

# set manual DNS:
curl --netrc -X POST "http://<ip>:4150/network/dns" \
  -d '{"primary":"207.246.121.77","secondary":"163.172.141.219"}'

# revert to DHCP-provided DNS:
curl --netrc -X POST "http://<ip>:4150/network/dns" -d '{"automatic":true}'
```

Setting DNS rewrites the active connection profile, so the connection may blip
briefly while it re-applies. Also exposed as the `get_dns` / `set_dns` MCP
tools. (Requires the `nifm:a` admin service, which the sysmodule opens at boot.)

### Process control

```
GET  /process?titleId=690000000000000d   -> {"titleId":"...","running":true,"pid":"73"}
POST /process/start    {"titleId":"690000000000000d"}
POST /process/stop     {"titleId":"690000000000000d"}
POST /process/restart  {"titleId":"690000000000000d"}
```

Start, stop and query any program by its title id — the id `GET /titles`
reports, and the directory name under `/atmosphere/contents` for a sysmodule.
A `0x` prefix is accepted. Process ids are returned as strings, since a `u64`
does not survive a JSON number in most clients.

This is what makes it possible to iterate on a sysmodule without rebooting:
stop it, `PUT` the rebuilt `exefs.nsp` through `/files`, then start it again.

A program does **not** need a `flags/boot2.flag` to be launched this way; that
flag only controls whether boot2 starts it automatically. Leaving it off while
developing is the safer arrangement, because a build that crashes during
startup can then no longer take the console down with it before anything is
reachable — you keep a working server to upload the fix through.

`/process/restart` waits for the old process to actually disappear before
relaunching (up to 3s), so a caller never races a half-dead process. Note that
`stop` is a hard kill: the program does not shut down cleanly, and one holding
system resources may leave them attached until the next reboot.

### Status

```
GET /status
```

```json
{"version":"1.1.0","firmware":"19.0.1","controllerAttached":true,"keepAwake":true,"uptimeSeconds":4242,"batteryPercent":87,"charging":true}
```

`batteryPercent`/`charging` are included when the battery service is available.

### System settings

```
GET  /settings/theme                      -> {"theme":"light"|"dark"}
POST /settings/theme       {"theme":"dark"}
GET  /settings/nickname                    -> {"nickname":"..."}
POST /settings/nickname    {"nickname":"Living Room"}
GET  /settings/brightness                  -> {"brightness":0.5}   (0.0-1.0)
POST /settings/brightness  {"brightness":0.8}
GET  /settings/volume                      -> {"volume":0.5}       (0.0-1.0)
POST /settings/volume      {"volume":0.3}
POST /settings/airplane    (empty body)    disable wireless (one-way)
GET  /settings/auto-time                   -> {"autoTime":true}
POST /settings/auto-time   {"autoTime":false}
GET  /settings/datetime                    -> {"year":2026,...,"timezone":"America/New_York"}
POST /settings/datetime    {"year":2026,"month":6,"day":19,"hour":14,"minute":30,"timezone":"America/New_York"}
```

`POST /settings/datetime` accepts any subset of fields (omitted ones keep their
current value), interprets the time in the given/current timezone, and disables
internet time sync so the manual value sticks. `theme` updates the stored
setting immediately but the HOME menu only shows it after it reloads
(sleep/wake or reboot).

```sh
curl -X POST "http://<ip>:4150/settings/theme" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"theme":"dark"}'
curl "http://<ip>:4150/settings/brightness"
```

> `POST /settings/airplane` disables all wireless and is **one-way**: the
> server becomes unreachable and wireless must be re-enabled physically on the
> console. There is intentionally no remote re-enable.

## Dev flavor (.nro)

Reloading a sysmodule requires a reboot, so for fast iteration the same server
core also builds as a regular homebrew application:

```sh
make -C app
nxlink -s app/sys-autopilot-app.nro
```

It reads the same `config.ini`, logs requests to the console, and exits with
the `+` button.

## Releases & contributing

CI (GitHub Actions) runs the host test suite on every push/PR and builds the
sysmodule inside the `devkitpro/devkita64` container, uploading the SD card
layout as an artifact.

Releases are managed with [changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets):

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm changeset        # record a change + semver intent
```

When changesets land on `main`, the release workflow opens a "Version
Packages" PR; merging it bumps `package.json` (which the Makefiles inject
into the build as `APP_VERSION`), updates `CHANGELOG.md`, and publishes a
GitHub Release with the SD-card zip and dev `.nro` attached.

## Notes & limitations

- Screenshots fail (HTTP 500 / tool error with the Horizon result code) in the
  rare contexts where the OS blocks capture.
- The server is single-threaded by design: input taps with a duration block
  until released, which conveniently serializes agent actions. Socket I/O is
  non-blocking under the hood (poll()-based with a 10s inactivity timeout),
  so a stalled or misbehaving client cannot wedge the server.
- MCP transport details: stateless (no session IDs), plain JSON responses (no
  SSE), `GET /mcp` returns 405, JSON-RPC batching unsupported (removed in MCP
  2025-06-18 anyway).
- No TLS; treat the API as LAN-trusted.
